# best html template practice

## introduction

as a backend programmer, I am always trapped by design a frontend template to integrate with backend.
I used using bootstrap template to design.
but there have some deficiencies. 

1. i have to understand bootstrap component to customize my website, but my css skill is poor. 
2. I can't improve my understand to css and sometimes i really feel frustrated when something was not perform
as i expected.

so i decide to develop a simple template use simple css knowledge.
